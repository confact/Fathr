Fathr - The Father of MVC+CMS frameworks.
=============
This is a schoolwork i did for a course on www.bth.se

It is under work, when it's more or less complete, it will be inspired on CodeIgniter which i really digg.

### Just Framework
This branch is just the framework for those who want it clean and just code on.

### Contribute
We are in need of helpers, fixes and improvements. Be free to do pull-requests and report bugs and request helpers in the issues-tab.


### Setup:
1. rename the configs in the config directory to config.php and db.php, in other words, just remove "_sample" from the name.
2. Setup your config with right application path and so on. Also setup your database config, you find it in the config directory.
3. Setup your base in the .htaccess file so it is correct for your path.
4. Fathring on, Create controllers, models and views and code on.
