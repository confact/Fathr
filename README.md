Fathr - The Father of MVC+CMS frameworks.
=============
This is a schoolwork i did for a course on www.bth.se

It is under work, when it are more or less complete, it will have the description like below:

it is very inspired of CodeIgniter that i really digg. This framework has a already inbuilt CMS-framework over the MVC-framework for more differents ways to work with a webpage.


### Setup:
1. rename the configs in the config directory to config.php and db.php, in other words, just remove "_sample" from the name.
2. Setup your config with right application path and so on. Also setup your database config, you find it in the config directory.
3. Setup your base in the .htaccess file so it is correct for your path.
4. Go to your Fathr url in your browser. it will automatically redirect you to the setup if you haven't already setup the database with tables and data manually.
4. Fathring on. You are finish.
